## 🌐 Description

The PySpark Project for Sales Analysis is a Python-powered solution designed for in-depth exploration and analysis of sales data. Leveraging the robust capabilities of PySpark, this project covers a spectrum of data engineering tasks, from cleaning and transforming raw data to performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and deriving valuable insights through querying.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **PySpark**: The backbone of the project, providing a distributed computing framework for efficient data processing.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing data engineering tasks and analysis.
- **CSV**: The project sources data from a CSV file, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Python-based techniques ensure data quality and prepare it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Python scripts drive in-depth exploration, unveiling patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- **Querying**: Leveraging PySpark's querying capabilities to extract meaningful insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Python libraries facilitate data visualization, enhancing the interpretation of SQL query results.
